str. Filename to reference the files asociated to this mesure,int. SoapySDR is able to select the channel/antenna to take the mesures with a number from 0 to the numer of antenas -1. Depeds on the SDR used.,float. Seconds. Total maximum time to keep this experiment runing,int. How many mew spectra will be taken before saving them again,int. dB. SoapySDR variable for Gain. Depeds on the SDR used.,'float. Hz. Frequency to sample the radio signal, i. e. twice the bandwidth.',int. only a 2-power. Length of the radio signal recorded,float. Hz. Min frequency of the spectrum to be recorded. This frequency will be included. . Depeds on the SDR used.,float. Hz. Max frequency of the spectrum to be recorded. This frequency will be included. . Depeds on the SDR used.,float. Seconds. The minimal time to wait between the capture of the entire spectrum,int. Numer of times each segment of the spectrum will be recorded an averaged.,'int. Number of parts in wich the spectrum will be divideded, the first and last parts will be discarded. Can be set to 1 to avoid discarting parts. Canâ€™t be 2.'
